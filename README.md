# Disconnected

Whenever I try to [close online accounts](https://grantwinney.com/when-you-close-an-online-account-dont-forget-to-check-any-other-connected-accounts/) that I'm no longer using, I'm annoyed (but not really surprised) by how difficult some sites make it to delete your account. So, here's a list of "close" or "delete" pages (or help pages) for various sites. Feel free to submit a PR to add to the list!

**[Uphold](https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005420646-How-do-I-cancel-my-account-)**<br>Someone wins the awful user experience award. Involves the creation of a _separate_ account on their support site, in order to submit a request to delete the original account.
