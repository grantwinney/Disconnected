# Disconnected

Whenever I try to [close online accounts](https://grantwinney.com/when-you-close-an-online-account-dont-forget-to-check-any-other-connected-accounts/) that I'm no longer using, I'm annoyed (but not really surprised) by how difficult some sites make it to delete your account. So, here's a list of "close" or "delete" pages (or help pages) for various sites. Feel free to submit a PR to add to the list!

### [Spotify](https://support.spotify.com/us/account_payment_help/account_help/close-account/)

### [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/account/delete)

### [Twitter](https://twitter.com/settings/deactivate)

### [Uphold](https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005420646-How-do-I-cancel-my-account-)
One of the weirdest processes. While submitting a "ticket" to close my account, it asked me to create a _separate_ account on their support site. I declined. 5 minutes later I got three separate emails, telling me they received my request (huh?), my account was now closed (okay...), and my account was suspended due to a security risk but I could open another ticket to ask why (what?!?!).

### [Walmart](https://help.walmart.com/app/ask)
Click on the different help "tiles" until a section shows up below with links for chatting, sending an email, etc.
